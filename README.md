# rv-hud

This project should result in a control unit of a mobile home. The aim of the project is to display and control the sensors and functions of the motorhome centrally via a touch panel.

The whole thing will work together with WOMO\_LIN to ensure the greatest possible compatibility with different manufacturers.

## Current State

Currently, the design is being developed and implemented. As soon as this is completed, the necessary functions will be added.
